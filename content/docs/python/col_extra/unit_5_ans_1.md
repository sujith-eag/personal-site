## Exception Handling


Explain exception handling in python in detail with the help of an example.

How do you handle an exception? Demonstrate try-finally clause.

How do you handle an exception? Explain all the three keywords in exception handling. Write a simple program to show how an except clause is used for handing multiple exceptions.



Illustrate user defined exceptions with suitable examples.

Develop a Python program to demonstrate user defined exception.



Illustrate “catching an exception is programmatically good and necessary mechanism” with exception handling mechanism in python. Demonstrate the working of any six exceptions in python.


Discover what exception is produced by each of the following points. Then develop small example program that illustrates catching the exceptions using try statement(s) and continuing with execution after the interrupt.
*  Division by zero
*  Opening a file that does not exist
*  Indexing a list with an illegal value


Discover what exception is produced by each of the following points. Then, for each, write a small example program that illustrates catching the exception using a try statement and continuing with exception after the interrupt.
i. Division by zero
ii. Opening a file that does not exist
iii. Indexing a list with an illegal value
iv. Using an improper key with a dictionary
v. Passing an improperly formatted expression to the function expr( )
vi. Using unindented code.


___

## File I/O


List and describe ANY FIVE file open modes in python.
List and describe the file open modes in python.

Demonstrate the methods to read and write text files in python.

Explain with the help of an example the different functions used with files.


Explain the different methods available for manipulating the text files.





Develop a script that will prompt the user for a file name, then print all lines from the file that contain the Python comment character #.


Develop a script that asks the user for a file name, then prints the number of characters, words and lines in the file.


Develop a python script that will prompt the user for a string and a file name, and then print all lines in the file that contains the string entered by the user.


Discuss all the file accessing modes and also write python program to count the number of words, characters and lines from the files and also copy the contents of the file into another file.


Develop a python program that will prompt the user for a file name, read all the numbers from the file into a list, separate positive and negative numbers from the list, and store them in separate files.


Develop a script that will prompt the user for a file name, read all the lines from the file into a list, sort the list, then print the lines in sorted order as well as write to a file.


Write a python program to sort the file contents in reverse order and write the sorted contents along with line number.


Develop a script to open a file and count number of lines in the file. Find the middle 3 lines in the file and write it on to another file. Repeat the same steps until there are only 3 lines are left.


Construct a python program to read a text file and display first 5 lines and last five lines.


Consider the following file `num_pairs.txt`, read data and find the line total and write the line as well as total to a new file.
```
num_pairs.txt

1.3  3.4
2    4.2
-1   1
```

___

Consider the following program which contains some errors. You may
assume that the comments within the program accurately describe the program’s intended behavior.
```
# Get two numbers from the user
n1, n2 = eval(input()) # 1

# Compute sum of the two numbers
print(n1 + n2) # 2

# Compute average of the two numbers
print(n1+n2/2) # 3

# Compute a quotient
print(n1/d1) # 4

# Compute a product
n1*n2 = d1 # 5
```
For each line listed in the comments, indicate whether or not an interpreter error, run-time exception, or logic error is present. Not all lines contain an error.
