Develop a script using regular expressions to search and replace a string in a given input.


Write a Python program to check the following using regular expressions:
i) A given USN of RIT MCA student is valid or not.
ii) to find the sequences of one upper case letter followed by lower case letters.
iii) matches a string that has an 'a' followed by anything, ending in 'b'.


Develop a script using regular expressions to convert a date of yyyy-mm-dd format to dd-mm-yyyy format.


Develop script using regular expressions to match a string that contains only upper and lowercase letters, numbers, and underscores.



Write a Python program to check the validity of a password given by the user using regular expression.
The Password should satisfy the following criteria:
i. Contain at least 1 letter between a and z
ii. Contain at least 1 number between 0 and 9
iii. Contain at least 1 letter between A and Z
iv. Contain at least 1 character from $, #, @
v. Minimum length of password: 6
vi. Maximum length of password: 12.


How do you define regular expressions in python? Write regular expression to match the following patterns:
(i) The file names chap01, chap02, chap03, chap10, chap11 and chap12
(ii) containing ‘RIT’ as an embedded string except at the beginning or end
(iii) the file names that end with at least two digits and don’t begin with an alphabet
(iv) the files except ‘.py’ extension

Write short note on: i) Data hiding ii) Static Member.

Explain the following concepts in python with example:  i) Data hiding ii) Inheritance.






Define a class time which has 3 members hours, minutes and seconds. Use constructor to initialize the values and develop functions to add two times and display.


Create a class Rectangle. The constructor for this class should take two numeric arguments, which are the width and height. Add methods to compute the area and perimeter of the rectangle, as well as methods that simply return the height and width. Add a method is Square that returns a Boolean value if the rectangle is a square.


Design a Python class called account and implement the functions deposit, withdraw and display balance.


Define a class BankAccount. The constructor for this class will take one argument i.e. default balance for opening an account. Add methods withdraw, deposit and displayBalance to do respective operations. In the withdraw method check for sufficient balance before withdrawal. And also keep track of number of bank accounts.



Define a class BankAccount. The constructor for this class will take one argument i.e. default balance for opening an account. Add methods to read, withdraw, deposit and display to do respective operations.
i) In the read method store account holder information like name, email, phone and type of account.
ii) If the account type is SB – add 5% interest and if account type is FD – add 8% interest to the balance.
iii) In the withdraw method check for sufficient balance before withdrawal.



Create a class called Stack, Add methods to perform different stack operations like push, pop, is_empty,is_full and display.



Suppose you are designing the software for an ATM (Automatic Teller Machine). Write at least three different scenarios describing the use of your system. From these create CRC cards to describe the various classes that might be used to implement your design. Walk through your scenarios to make sure that all activity is matched to a class.
