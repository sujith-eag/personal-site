**object references, cloning, and deep copying** in JavaScript.

## **Objects vs. Primitives**

- **Primitives** (like strings, numbers, booleans, etc.) are always copied **by value**. This means when a primitive variable is assigned to another, a **copy** of the value is made.
  
  ```js
  let message = "hello";
  let phrase = message; // phrase is a copy of message
  ```

- **Objects** are copied **by reference**. When you assign an object to a variable, that variable doesn't hold the object itself but rather the **memory address** where the object is stored. 

  ```js
  let user = { name: "John" };
  let admin = user;  // 'admin' holds a reference to the same object as 'user'
  
  admin.name = "Pete"; // Modifying 'admin' also changes 'user'
  
  console.log(user.name);  // "Pete"
  ```

---

## **Reference Behavior of Objects**

- **When you assign an object to another variable**, the second variable holds a **reference** to the same object, meaning **both variables point to the same object**.
  
  ```js
  let object1 = { value: 10 };
  let object2 = { value: 10 };
  let object3 = object1;  // object3 references object1
  
  console.log(object1 == object2);  // false (different objects, same structure)
  console.log(object1 == object3);  // true (same object)
  ```

---

## **Reassigning Object Variables**

- **Reassigning** a variable that holds an object **does not affect other variables** pointing to the same object. Only the reference changes for the reassigned variable.

  ```js
  let animal = { species: "dog" };
  let dog = animal; // both 'animal' and 'dog' reference the same object
  
  animal = { species: "cat" };  // 'animal' is reassigned to a new object
  
  console.log(animal);  // { species: "cat" }
  console.log(dog);     // { species: "dog" } (dog still points to the original object)
  ```

## **Cloning and Merging Objects**

### **Shallow Copy (Copying References)**

- When copying an object, only **primitive values** are copied by value, while **objects** inside the object are still copied by reference.

  ```js
  let user = { name: "John", age: 30 };
  let copy = {};

  // Copying properties of 'user' into 'copy'
  for (let prop in user) {
    copy[prop] = user[prop];
  }

  copy.name = "Pete";  // Changing copy does not affect user
  console.log(user.name);  // "John"
  ```

### **Using `Object.assign` for Shallow Copy**

- `Object.assign()` performs a **shallow copy**. This means it copies the top-level properties, but nested objects are copied by reference.
```js
Object.assign(dest, ...sources)
```

  ```js
  let user = { name: "John" };
  let permit1 = { canView: true };
  let permit2 = { canEdit: true };

  // Merging multiple objects into one
  Object.assign(user, permit1, permit2);
  console.log(user.name);    // "John"
  console.log(user.canView); // true
  console.log(user.canEdit); // true
  ```

### **Using `Object.assign()` to Clone**

- `Object.assign()` can also be used to create a clone of an object. However, it only performs a **shallow copy**.

  ```js
  let user = { name: "John", age: 30 };
  let copy = Object.assign({}, user);  // Creating a shallow copy

  console.log(copy.name);  // "John"
  ```
  
Spread syntax can also be used to clone an object.

### **Deep Cloning (Nested Objects)**

- **Deep cloning** is needed when an object contains other objects. A shallow copy will only copy references to nested objects, not the actual content.

  To make a true **deep copy**, we must copy nested objects properly, and tools like `structuredClone()` can help with that. [structuredClone()]((https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/structuredClone))

---

## **Deep Cloning with `structuredClone()`**

- The `structuredClone()` method performs **deep cloning** of objects, copying both the object and its nested properties.

  ```js
  let user = {
    name: "John",
    age: 30,
    sizes: {
      height: 182,
      width: 50
    }
  };

  let clone = structuredClone(user);

  console.log(user.sizes == clone.sizes); // false (they are different objects)
  user.sizes.width = 60;
  console.log(clone.sizes.width); // 50 (clone is unaffected)
  ```

- `structuredClone()` handles more than just objects. It can clone most data types, including arrays, primitive values, and supports **circular references** (where an object refers to itself).

  **Example with Circular References**:
  ```js
  let user = {};
  user.me = user;  // Circular reference

  let clone = structuredClone(user);
  console.log(clone.me === clone); // true (clone maintains circular reference)
  ```

- **Limitations**: `structuredClone()` **cannot** clone objects with functions, such as methods.
  ```js
  structuredClone({ f: function(){} }); // Error
  ```

---

## **Summary**

- **Objects** are stored and copied **by reference**, meaning variables point to the same object in memory.
- **Primitives** are copied **by value**, meaning variables hold independent copies of the value.
- **Shallow copying** (e.g., using `Object.assign()`) copies top-level properties, but nested objects are still referenced.
- **Deep copying** (e.g., using `structuredClone()`) creates independent copies of the object and all its nested properties.
- `structuredClone()` supports circular references but cannot clone functions.
