Concepts of **methods**, **`this`**, and **chaining** in JavaScript:

---

## **Methods**

- **Method**: A method is a function that is a property of an object. Methods allow objects to "act" in a specific way by performing actions based on the object’s properties or behavior.
 
```js
let user = {
  name: "John",
  sayHi: function() {
    alert("Hello");
  }
};

user.sayHi(); // Hello
```
`sayHi` is a method of the `user` object. When `user.sayHi()` is called, it alerts `"Hello"`.

Pre-Declaring a Function and Adding it as a Method:
```js
function sayHi() {
  alert("Hello");
}

let user = {};
user.sayHi = sayHi;
user.sayHi(); // Hello
```

### **Method Shorthand**
In ES6, there’s a shorthand for defining methods within an object literal. You can omit the `function` keyword and just use the method name followed by parentheses:

```js
let user = {
  sayHi() {
    alert("Hello");
  }
};
```

This is equivalent to the following, but shorter:

```js
let user = {
  sayHi: function() {
    alert("Hello");
  }
};
```

---

## **`this` in Methods**

The `this` keyword is commonly used inside methods to refer to the object the method belongs to. 

- **`this`** refers to the object that **owns** the method.
  
In the following example, the `sayHi` method uses `this.name` to access the `name` property of the `user` object:

```js
let user = {
  name: "John",
  sayHi() {
    alert(this.name); // "this" refers to the user object
  }
};

user.sayHi(); // John
```
During execution, the value of `this` will be `user`.
`this` refers to the `user` object, and `this.name` accesses the `name` property.

---

### **`this` is Not Bound (Dynamic)**

In JavaScript, the value of `this` is **determined at runtime** and depends on how the function is **called**, not where it is declared. 

This means that if `this` is used in a method, its value can change based on the **context** of the call.
Using `this`, it allows for same method definition to be used in multiple objects. 

```js
let user = {
  name: "John",
  introduceSelf() {
    console.log(`Hi! I'm ${this.name}`);
  }
};

user.introduceSelf(); // "Hi! I'm John"
```

However, if you call the method in a different context, `this` will refer to the new context:
```js
let introduce = user.introduceSelf;
introduce(); // "Hi! I'm undefined" or throws an error in strict mode.
```
In this case, `this` no longer refers to the `user` object because the function `introduce` was called without an object context.

---

### **`this` in Constructors**

You can use `this` to create methods inside a constructor function, which allows for **object reuse** across multiple instances:

```js
function Person(name) {
  this.name = name;
  this.introduceSelf = function() {
    console.log(`Hi! I'm ${this.name}`);
  };
}

let person1 = new Person("Chris");
let person2 = new Person("Deepthi");

person1.introduceSelf(); // "Hi! I'm Chris"
person2.introduceSelf(); // "Hi! I'm Deepthi"
```

In this case, `this.name` and `this.introduceSelf` work because `this` refers to each specific instance of `Person`.

### **Arrow Functions and `this`**

### [[3.2_arrow_function#Arrow function have no `this`.|Arrow functions have no 'this']]

Unlike regular functions, **arrow functions** do not have their own `this`. They inherit `this` from the surrounding context (lexical scoping). This can lead to unexpected behavior when used in methods.

```js
let user = {
  name: "John",
  sayHi: () => {
    alert(this.name); // `this` is not bound to user, it's inherited from the surrounding scope
  }
};

user.sayHi(); // undefined (or error in strict mode)
```

In the example above, `this` in the arrow function is inherited from the global context (or undefined in strict mode), not from the `user` object.

## **A Simple Calculator Object**

Here's an example of how you can use methods and `this` to create a simple calculator object with `read()`, `sum()`, and `multiply()` methods:

```js
let calculator = {
  read() {
    this.a = +prompt('Give a?', 0);
    this.b = +prompt('Give b?', 0);
  },
  sum() {
    return this.a + this.b;
  },
  multiply() {
    return this.a * this.b;
  }
};

calculator.read(); // Prompt the user for inputs
alert(calculator.sum()); // Show the sum
alert(calculator.multiply()); // Show the product
```

### **Method Explanation:**
- `read()`: Prompts the user for two values and stores them as properties `a` and `b` of the `calculator` object.
- `sum()`: Returns the sum of `a` and `b`.
- `multiply()`: Returns the product of `a` and `b`.

## **Method Chaining**

JavaScript allows for **method chaining**, where multiple method calls are linked together in a single line. For this to work, each method must return the object itself (`this`), so the next method can be called on it.

Here's an example using an object that represents a ladder:

```js
let ladder = {
  step: 0,
  up() {
    this.step++;
    return this; // Return the object to enable chaining
  },
  down() {
    this.step--;
    return this; // Return the object to enable chaining
  },
  showStep() {
    alert(this.step);
    return this; // Return the object to enable chaining
  }
};

// Chaining method calls
ladder.up().up().down().showStep().down(); // step = 1
```

In the example:
- `ladder.up()` increments the `step`.
- `ladder.down()` decrements the `step`.
- `ladder.showStep()` displays the current `step`.
- By returning `this` from each method, you can chain calls together.

---

### **Summary:**

- **Methods**: Functions that are properties of an object.
- **`this`**: Refers to the object that owns the method and allows access to its properties.
- **Arrow Functions**: Do not have their own `this`; they inherit it from the surrounding context.
- **Chaining**: Multiple method calls on the same object can be chained by returning `this` from each method.
