## **Setting Object Members**

### **1. Assigning Values to Object Properties**

You can set or change the values of an object's properties using either dot notation or bracket notation and assignment operator.

```js
// Using dot notation
person.age = 45;
person["name"]["last"] = "Cratch";

// Using bracket notation
person["eyes"] = "hazel";
person.farewell = function () {
  console.log("Bye everybody!");
};
```

### **2. Bracket Notation for Dynamic Property Names**

Bracket notation allows you to use variables as property names, making it useful when property names need to be dynamic or come from user input.

```js
const dataName = nameInput.value;
const dataValue = nameValue.value;

// Using bracket notation to set the property
person[dataName] = dataValue;

// Example: Setting a dynamic property name and value
const dataName = "height";
const dataValue = "1.70m";

person[dataName] = dataValue;  // person.height = "1.70m"
```

**Note**: Dot notation cannot use variables as property names:
```js
person.dataName = "height";  // This is invalid, it assigns "height" as a string literal, not the value in the variable `dataName`.
```

## **Working with Objects**

### **1. Reading Properties**

If a property doesnâ€™t exist on an object, JavaScript returns `undefined`.

```js
let day1 = {
  squirrel: false,
  events: ["work", "touched tree", "pizza", "running"]
};

console.log(day1.squirrel);  // false
console.log(day1.wolf);  // undefined (property doesn't exist)

day1.wolf = false; // Create the "wolf" property
console.log(day1.wolf);  // false

delete day1.squirrel; // Remove the "squirrel" property
console.log(day1.squirrel);  // undefined (property no longer exists)
```

### **2. The `delete` Operator**

The `delete` operator removes a specified property from an object.

```js
delete day1.squirrel;
console.log(day1.squirrel);  // undefined
```

## **Computed Properties in Object Literals**

You can use square brackets `[]` inside object literals to dynamically set property names. This is known as *computed properties*.

```js
let fruit = prompt("Which fruit to buy?", "apple");  // user input with default value "apple"
let bag = {
  [fruit]: 5,  // property name is dynamically taken from the `fruit` variable
};
alert(bag.apple);  // If user chooses "apple", this alerts "5"

// [fruit] menas property name is taken from fruit.
// so bag will have  { apple: 5}
```

This works the same as:

```js
let fruit = prompt("Which fruit to buy?", "apple");
let bag = {};

bag[fruit] = 5;  // property name taken from `fruit` variable
```

### **3. Complex Expressions in Computed Properties**

You can use more complex expressions within the square brackets.

```js
let fruit = "apple";
let bag = {
  [fruit + 'Computers']: 5  // property name is "appleComputers"
};

console.log(bag.appleComputers);  // 5
```

## **Mutability of Objects**

Objects are mutable, meaning their values can be changed after they are created. 

```js
let object1 = {value: 10};
object1.value = 15;  // Modify the existing value
```

### **Immutability of Primitive Types**

Primitive data types like strings, numbers, and booleans are *immutable*. This means their values cannot be changed directly after assignment.

```js
let str = "hello";
str[0] = "H";  // This has no effect, as strings are immutable.

console.log(str);  // "hello" (not "Hello")
```

### **Summary**

- **Dot Notation**: Used for setting and accessing object properties with known names.
- **Bracket Notation**: Useful for dynamic property names and setting properties using variables or expressions.
- **Delete Operator**: Removes a property from an object.
- **Computed Properties**: Allows using dynamic names when defining object properties.
- **Mutability**: Objects are mutable, meaning their properties can be changed; primitive types (e.g., strings, numbers) are immutable.
