The [forâ€¦in](https://javascript.info/object#forin) loop is used to iterate over the **keys/properties** of an object. It allows us to walk through the keys (or property names) in an object.

### **The `in` Operator**

The `in` operator is used to check if a specific property exists in an object. It returns `true` if the property is present, and `false` otherwise.

```js
"property" in object
```
- `"property"`: The name of the property as a string (it can also be a variable holding the name).
- `object`: The object to check for the property.

```js
let user = {name: "John", age: 30};

alert("age" in user);  // true (the property 'age' exists in user)
alert("bla" in user);  // false (the property 'bla' does not exist in user)
```

**Using Variables with `in`:**
If we omit quotes it refers to a variable, that variable should contain the actual name to be tested.
```js
let user = {age: 30};
let key = "age";

alert(key in user);  // true (the property 'age' exists in user)
```

**Handling `undefined`:**
The `in` operator will return `true` even if a property exists but its value is `undefined`.

```js
let obj = { test: undefined };

alert(obj.test); // undefined (the property exists with value 'undefined')
alert("test" in obj); // true (the property 'test' exists)
```

## **`for..in` Loop:**

The `for..in` loop is specifically designed for iterating over the **keys** of an object. It allows us to access each property name (key) one by one.

```js
for (key in object) {
  // Code to execute for each property of the object
}
```
- `key`: The variable that will hold the name of the current property.
- `object`: The object whose properties are being iterated.


To iterate over the properties of an object and output both the property names (keys) and their corresponding values:
```js
let user = {
  name: "John",
  age: 30,
  isAdmin: true,
};

for (let key in user) {
  alert(key);  // Outputs the name of the property
  alert(user[key]);  // Outputs the value of the property
}
// name
// John
// age
// 30
// isAdmin
// true
```

**Note:** The looping variable (`key` in this case) can be named anything you prefer, such as `prop`, `field`, etc. The example `for (let prop in user)` is also widely used.

### **Order of Properties in Objects**

The order in which properties are looped over in an object depends on whether the property names are **integers** or **non-integers**.

- **Integer property names** are ordered by their numeric value, regardless of whether they are stored as strings.
- **Non-integer property names** (i.e., strings that are not numbers) are listed in the order they were created.

**Example of Integer vs Non-integer Order:**
```js
let codes = {
  "+49": "Germany",
  "+41": "Switzerland",
  "+44": "Britain",
  "+1": "USA"
};

for (let code in codes) {
  alert(+code);  // Outputs the numeric value of the country code
}
// Output:
// 49
// 41
// 44
// 1
```

- When you iterate over properties with integer names (like `"1"`, `"44"`, `"49"`), JavaScript **converts** them to numbers and orders them numerically.
- In this case, if we want to preserve the order of non-integer property names, we can prefix the integer strings with a `+` (e.g., `"+49"` becomes `"49"`).

### **Use Case of `for..in`**

The `for..in` loop is typically used when you need to iterate over **object properties** and doesn't work with arrays in most cases (as array indices are considered numeric and `for..in` might return unexpected results).

For arrays, the `for...of` loop is preferred since it directly iterates over the values rather than the keys.

## **Summary**

- **`in` operator**: Used to check if a property exists in an object, even if its value is `undefined`.
- **`for..in` loop**: Loops through the **keys** of an object. It's useful for working with object properties but not typically used for arrays.
- **Order of object properties**: Properties with numeric-like names are sorted numerically, while other properties are listed in the creation order.
- **Integer properties**: JavaScript automatically converts string numbers into integers and sorts them accordingly.
