### **Ternary Operator / Conditional Operator**

The `?` operator is called "ternary" because it has **three** operands, making it unique in JavaScript. It's often referred to as the **conditional** or **question mark** operator. It provides a shorthand for `if-else` statements.

The basic syntax of the ternary operator is:
```js
let result = condition ? value1 : value2;

	boolean ? runIfTrue : runIfFalse
```
If the `condition` is `true`, the expression returns `value1`; otherwise, it returns `value2`.


```js
let accessAllowed = (age > 18) ? true : false;
```
This is equivalent to:
```js
if (age > 18) {
	accessAllowed = true;
} else {
	accessAllowed = false;
}
```

- The `?` operator has low precedence, meaning it runs after operators like `>`.


```js
console.log(true ? 1 : 2);    // 1
console.log(false ? 1 : 2);   // 2
```

```js
const greeting = isBirthday ? "Happy birthday" : "Good morning";
```

```js
// switching b/w black and white theme
select.value === "black" ? update("black", "white") : update ("white", "black");
// make black to white,  or  white to black
```

### **Multiple `?` Operators (Chaining)**

You can chain multiple ternary operators together to handle more complex conditions:

```js
let age = prompt("How old are you?", 18);

let message = (age < 3) ? "Hi, baby" :      // If true, "Hi, baby"
	(age < 18) ? "Hello" :                    // If true, "Hello"
		(age < 100) ? "Greetings" :            // If true, "Greetings"
			"What an unusual age";             // Default message

alert(message);
```

- The operator evaluates the condition before the `?` and selects one of the two options after the `?` based on the result.
- In `a ? b : c`, it returns `b` if `a` is `true`, and `c` if `a` is `false`.


This is equivalent to using `if...else`:
```js
if (age < 3) {
	message = 'Hi, baby';
} else if (age < 18) {
	message = 'Hello';
} else if (age < 100) {
	message = 'Greetings';
} else {
	message = 'What an unusual age';
}
```

### **Non-traditional Use of `?`**

Itâ€™s possible to use the ternary operator without assigning a value to a variable, though it's generally discouraged. For example:

```js
let company = prompt('Which company?', '');

(company == 'Netscape') ? alert('Right!') : alert('Wrong.');
```

However, this usage is **not recommended** because:

- It sacrifices readability and clarity.
- The purpose of the ternary operator is to return one of two values, not to execute different branches of code. For branching logic, an `if...else` is more appropriate.

Our eyes scan the code vertically. Code blocks which span several lines are easier to understand than a long, horizontal instruction set.

### **Limitations of `?`**

#### **No `break` or `continue` with `?`**

The ternary operator only works with **expressions** and cannot handle **statements** like `break` or `continue`.

```js
if (i > 5) {
	alert(i);
} else {
	continue;  // Invalid
}

// This will result in an error:
(i > 5) ? alert(i) : continue;  // 'continue' is not allowed here
```

In such cases, use an `if...else` statement instead.

### **Summary:**

- The ternary operator is a concise way to write `if-else` logic.
- Use it to choose between two values based on a condition.
- Avoid using the ternary operator for executing code blocks (e.g., with `alert` or `continue`), as it reduces readability.
- Remember that the ternary operator has **low precedence**, so its evaluation order is important.
