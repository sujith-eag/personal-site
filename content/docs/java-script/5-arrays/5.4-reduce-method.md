### `reduce()` Method

The `reduce()` method is one of the most powerful and flexible array methods in JavaScript. It allows you to **reduce** an array to a single value by iterating over all elements and applying a function that combines each element with an accumulator (the result of previous calculations).

[arr.reduce](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/reduce) and [arr.reduceRight](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/reduceRight)

```js
let value = arr.reduce(function(accumulator, currentItem, index, array) {
    // callback logic
}, initialValue);
```

- **`accumulator`**: This is the cumulative value that is returned after each iteration. It’s the value that is built up as the loop progresses.
- **`currentItem`**: The current array item being processed.
- **`index`** (optional): The index of the current item.
- **`array`** (optional): The array `reduce()` was called on.
- **`initialValue`**: This is the value that `accumulator` will start with. If not provided, it defaults to the first element of the array.

---

### Basic Example: Summing an Array

To sum all the elements in an array, we can use `reduce()`:

```js
const arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

let result = arr.reduce((sum, current) => sum + current, 0);

console.log(result); // 15
```

Here’s how it works:
1. **`sum`** starts as the `initialValue` (0).
2. **`current`** is each element of the array in turn.
3. On each iteration, `sum` is updated by adding the current element.
4. The final result after all iterations is `15`.

If we omit the `initialValue`:

```js
let result = arr.reduce((sum, current) => sum + current);
console.log(result); // 15
```

In this case, the `initialValue` is set to the first element (`1`), and the sum begins from there.

### Example 2: Multiplying All Elements

The `reduce()` method can also be used to perform a cumulative calculation, such as multiplying all the numbers in an array:

```js
const arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

const product = arr.reduce((total, currentItem) => total * currentItem, 1);

console.log(product); // 120
```

- The **`total`** starts at `1` (since multiplying by `1` has no effect).
- Each element of the array is multiplied by the accumulator (`total`), and the result accumulates through the iterations.

### Example 3: Creating a Keyed Object from an Array

You can use `reduce()` to transform an array of objects into an object with a custom key. For example, turning an array of users into an object where the `id` is the key:

```js
let users = [
  {id: "john", name: "John Smith", age: 20},
  {id: "ann", name: "Ann Smith", age: 24},
  {id: "pete", name: "Pete Peterson", age: 31}
];

function groupById(array) {
  return array.reduce((obj, value) => {
    obj[value.id] = value;
    return obj;
  }, {});
}
// obj is accumilator with {} as starting value.
// value are objects from the array.
// value.id gives id value, to that the object is assigned.
// all these are accumilated in {} a object

let usersById = groupById(users);

console.log(usersById);
// {
//   "john": {id: "john", name: "John Smith", age: 20},
//   "ann": {id: "ann", name: "Ann Smith", age: 24},
//   "pete": {id: "pete", name: "Pete Peterson", age: 31}
// }
```

- **`obj`** is the accumulator, starting as an empty object `{}`.
- On each iteration, the `id` of each user is used as the key, and the user object is assigned to that key.

---

### Example 4: Getting the Average Age of Users

We can also use `reduce()` to calculate the average of a property (e.g., `age`) in an array of objects:

```js
let john = {id: "john", name: "John Smith", age: 25};
let ann = {id: "ann", name: "Ann Smith", age: 29};
let pete = {id: "pete", name: "Pete Peterson", age: 30};

let arr = [john, ann, pete];

function getAverageAge(users) {
  return users.reduce((acc, user) => acc + user.age, 0) / users.length;
}

console.log(getAverageAge(arr)); // 28
```

- **`acc`** starts at `0` and accumulates the sum of the `age` property of each user.
- After the loop, the total sum is divided by the length of the array (`users.length`) to compute the average.

---

### Example 5: Sum of Tripled Even Numbers

You can chain `reduce()` with other array methods like `map()` and `filter()` to perform more complex transformations. For example, summing the tripled values of all even numbers:

```js
function sumOfTripledEvens(array) {
  return array
    .filter((num) => num % 2 === 0)     // filter out even numbers
    .map((num) => num * 3)               // multiply all by 3
    .reduce((acc, curr) => acc + curr);  // get total sum
}

console.log(sumOfTripledEvens([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]));  // 30
```

Here’s the breakdown:
1. **`filter()`**: Only even numbers are selected (`[2, 4]`).
2. **`map()`**: Each even number is tripled (`[6, 12]`).
3. **`reduce()`**: The tripled values are summed up (`6 + 12 = 30`).

### `reduceRight()`

`reduceRight()` works similarly to `reduce()`, but it processes the array from right to left, instead of left to right. It’s useful when the direction of processing matters.

```js
const arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

const result = arr.reduceRight((acc, current) => acc - current, 0);

console.log(result);  // 3
```

In this case, `reduceRight()` starts from the last element of the array, subtracting each subsequent element from the accumulator.

---

### Key Points:

- `reduce()` reduces an array to a **single value** by iterating through all elements and accumulating the result.
- The first argument of the callback is the **accumulator** (cumulative result), and the second is the **current item** in the iteration.
- The **initial value** is optional; if not provided, it defaults to the first item of the array.
- Always specify the **initial value** when the array may be empty or when the calculation requires a specific starting point.
- **`reduceRight()`** is similar to `reduce()` but processes the array from right to left.
