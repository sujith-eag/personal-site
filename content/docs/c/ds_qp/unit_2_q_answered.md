#### Queues: Introduction to Queues, Definition, Array Representation of Queues, Primitive operations of queue and its implementation; 

* What is Queue? List its types. Mention the limitations of Linear Queue. Also Explain the insert, delete and display operations on Queue with appropriate examples.

* Write a C program to simulate the insert and delete operations of a Queue. Trace the program for the following sequence of operations for Queue of size 3. i. Insert 3 elements ii. Delete 2 elements iii. Insert 3 elements.

**Answer :**

A Queue is a linear data structure that follows the First In, First Out (FIFO) principle. In a queue, the element that is inserted first is the one to be removed first. 
- Front: The front of the queue represents the position from where elements are removed.
- Rear: The rear of the queue represents the position where elements are added.

It can be visualized like a line of people standing at a counter; the person who arrives first is served first.

**Types of Queues:**
1. **Linear Queue**: A simple queue where elements are inserted at the rear end and removed from the front end.
2. **Circular Queue**: A queue where the last position is connected back to the first position, making it circular. It solves the problem of the wasted space in a linear queue.
3. **Priority Queue**: In this queue, elements are assigned priorities, and elements with higher priority are dequeued first.
4. **Double-Ended Queue (Deque)**: A queue where insertion and deletion can be done from both ends, i.e., both front and rear.

**Limitations of Linear Queue:**
1. **Fixed Size**: A linear queue has a fixed size, and once it is full, no more elements can be added, even if there is space in the middle of the queue after elements have been removed.
2. **Wasted Space**: In a linear queue, once elements are dequeued, the spaces occupied by them cannot be reused unless we rearrange the elements.

**Queue Operations:**
1. **Insert (Enqueue)**: To add an element to the rear of the queue.
2. **Delete (Dequeue)**: To remove an element from the front of the queue.
3. **Display**: To display all the elements in the queue.
4. IsEmpty and IsFull : to check empty and full queue

#### Applications of Queue

* Ticket Booking Systems:Managing people in a queue for seat allotments.
* Call Center Support:Customer calls handled in the order they are received.
* Printers:Print jobs are executed sequentially in the order of request.
* Messaging Systems:Managing message delivery in applications like SMS.
* CPU Task Scheduling:Processes waiting to be executed by the CPU.
* Networking:Packets waiting to be transmitted in routers.
* Order Processing:Online shopping orders being processed sequentially.
* Traffic Light Systems:Vehicles passing through intersections in a queued manner.
* Task Queues in Applications :Background jobs like email sending or notifications.

#### Types of Queues: How to overcome the drawbacks of Linear Queue using Circular Queue, Representation of Circular Queues, Deques and Priority Queues.

* Identify the limitations of linear queue? How can it be resolved by the circular queue?
* Explain the limitations of Linear Queue with an example. Also explain with the program how to overcome these limitations using Circular Queue.
* State the limitations of Linear Queue and explain how it will be resolved in Circular Queue. Explain the algorithms for Insertion and Deletion of elements in a circular queue.
* Write a program to perform insert and delete operations on Circular QUEUE.
* Write C functions for the Insertion and Deletion of elements in a circular queue. For an array of size 4, show (diagrammatically) the representation of the queue for the conditions.  i. Insert 3 elements   ii. Delete 2 elements  iii. Insert 3 elements    iv. Delete 1 element.
* Write C functions for Insertion and Deletion of elements in a circular queue. For an array of size 3, show (diagrammatically) the representation of the queue for the conditions.  i. Insert 3 elements   ii. Delete 2 elements   iii. Insert 3 elements   iv. Delete 1 element.

**Answer :**

A Linear Queue is a basic queue where the elements are added at the rear and removed from the front. However, it has some significant limitations:

**Fixed Size**:  Linear queues often have a fixed size declared in the beginning, meaning if the queue becomes full, no more elements can be inserted by adjusting the size dynamically.

**Wasted Space (Underutilization)**: In a linear queue, once the front of the queue moves forward after several `dequeue` operations, the space occupied by those elements cannot be reused. This causes wasted space, even if there is space available at the rear.

Suppose the queue has a size of 5 and the elements `10, 20, 30, 40, 50` are inserted and remove `10, 20`), the queue will look like:
```
Front -> 30, 40, 50 <- Rear
```
The space freed up by the `10` and `20` can't be reused, and thus, the queue will be "full" despite having free space at the front.

____

Circular Queue solves these limitations by circularly connecting the end of the queue to the front, for better utilization of space. In a circular queue, when the rear reaches the end of the array, it can wrap around to the beginning of the queue if space is available.

When elements are dequeued, the front pointer moves ahead, and the space at the front can be reused for enqueue operations as the rear moves into that space circularly when elements are added.

1. Enqueue `10, 20, 30, 40, 50`
2. Dequeue `10, 20`
3. Enqueue `60` â€” _Works because the space freed by `10` and `20` is reused._
```
Front -> 30, 40, 50, 60 <- Rear (after two dequeues)
```

---

Insertion (Enqueue) Algorithm in Circular Queue:
* Checking if the queue is full: Queue is full if the next position of the rear pointer is equal to the front pointer.  
* `front == (rear + 1) % max_size`

* Insert the element:  If the queue is not full, increment the `rear` pointer (circularly) and insert the element at the rear by Adjusting the pointer circularly using modulus.
* `rear = (rear + 1) % max_size`,   where `max_size` is the maximum size of the queue.

Deletion (Dequeue) Algorithm in Circular Queue:
* Check if the queue is empty:  The queue is empty if `front == -1`.
* Check if `front == rear` which means there is only one element, then rear and front are set to `-1` to show queue is empty.

- If the queue is not empty, remove the element at the front, and increment the `front` pointer (circularly).
- `front = (front + 1) % max_size`.

##### What do you mean by priority queue? Discuss different types of priority queue.

**Answer :**

Priority Queue is a data structure that operates similarly to a regular queue but each element in the priority queue is associated with a priority. The element with the highest priority is always served before the elements with lower priority, regardless of their insertion order. 

The order of elements depends on their priority levels so elements with high priority are dequeud first. If two elements have the same priority, they are dequeued according to their insertion order.

Priority queues are typically implemented using data structures that allow efficient access to the element with the highest (or lowest) priority:

* Explain how queue data structure is useful in categorizing data with an algorithm.
___

#### Static and Dynamic Memory Allocation

Static memory allocation is when memory allocation is done at compile time, and once the memory is allotted, it will remain from the beginning to end of the program. Cannot be changed or altered after allocation or while executing program.

Static memory allocation is fast and saves running time. Static memory allocation allots memory from the stack.

Static Memory used in array. `int a[5] = {1,2,3,4,5}`


Dynamic memory allocation is done at run time while execution is happening where the size of the data structure changes. Memory is allocated from heap for dynamic allocation.

Dynamic memory is more efficient as compared to static memory allocation since only required amount of memory is allocated and memory is not wasted by pre-allocating it.

In C, Dynamic memory allocation is done using library function 
* `malloc()` - `void* malloc(size)`
* `calloc()` - `void* calloc(n, size)`
* `free()` - for deallocating the memory

`malloc()` is memory allocation used to dynamicaally allocate a single large block of memory with specified size. It returns a void pointer which can be type cast into a pointer of any form. It will will have initialized default garbage value at each block.
`(cast-type*) malloc( element-size )`

`calloc()` is contiguous allocation similar to `malloc` but it initializes each block with a default value `0` and has one extra argument which takes the number of memory blocks needed.
`ptr = (cast-type*) calloc(n, element-size)`

`ralloc()` can be used to reallocate previously allocated memory if it was not sufficient.
`ptr = realloc(ptr, newSize)`

`free()` is used for dynamic de-allocation of memory to reduce wastage of memory. `free(ptr)`

_____

#### Linked list: Introduction


A linked list is a data Structure that consists a sequence of nodes which are a collection of nodes that are randomly stored in memory.
Each node has a two parts, data part stores the actual value and pointer part holds the reference to the next node in the list.

Extra pointer like head and tail are used to point at the first and last nodes in the list.

Linked list is designed to be efficient for Insertion and deletion of elements from any position in list (when compared to array) with searching taking `O(n)`


Advantages:
* Efficient memory usage (no pre-allocation).
* Dynamic size adjustment.
* Faster insertion and deletion (compared to arrays).

Disadvantages
* More memory usage due to the extra pointer in each node.
* Cannot be accessed directly like an array (requires sequential access).
* Slower search operations compared to arrays.


___

#### Representation and implementation of operations (Insertion, Deletion and Search) of Singly linked list

* Develop routines to perform each of the following operation on a linear list: i. Delete every second element for a list    ii. Return the number of elements in the list.
* Write an algorithm to search an item in a singly linked list. Explain the algorithm with example.
