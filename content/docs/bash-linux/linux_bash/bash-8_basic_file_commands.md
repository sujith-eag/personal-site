Many file commands can operate on many different types of items because Linux treats them all as files.
Linux treats various entities such as regular files, directories, symbolic links, pipes, sockets, and device files as files.

### **`file` Command**

The `file` command is used to determine the type of a file. It analyzes the contents of a file and returns a description of its type.

```bash
file <filename>
```

```bash
sujith@sujith-Latitude-7490:~$ file /home/sujith/Downloads/Print\ Resume.pdf
/home/sujith/Downloads/Print Resume.pdf: PDF document, version 1.4, 1 page(s)

sujith@sujith-Latitude-7490:~$ file /etc/passwd
/etc/passwd: ASCII text

sujith@sujith-Latitude-7490:~$ file -i /etc/passwd
/etc/passwd: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
```

The `-i` flag adds MIME type information along with the file description.

`~/data` refers to `/Users/sujith/data`, useful for absolute path typing.


#### **`cd` (Change Directory)**
[*cd*](/personal-site/docs/bash-linux/command-docs/cd-change-directory) - Used to change the current directory.

```bash
cd /home/user/Documents

- `-b`: Create backups of each destination file.
- `-L`: Follow symbolic links.
- `-p`: Preserve the original fileâ€™s metadata (permissions, timestamps).
- `-v`: Verbose mode (shows each step).
- `-I` `-s`   Create hard/symbolic link rather than physical copy
- `-u`  copy only if source is newer than the destination or destination missing

```bash

cp -r dir1 dir2          # Copy a directory recursively
```
