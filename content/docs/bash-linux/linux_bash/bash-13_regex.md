A **regular expression (regex)** is a string that defines a search pattern. 
It consists of a combination of **literal characters** and **meta-characters**. The meta-characters modify the literal characters to introduce flexibility and variability in pattern matching.

regex can **match more than just a literal string**. It can match a wide range of text patterns, allowing for flexible search, validation, and manipulation of strings. 
Regular expressions are commonly used to search for strings that follow a **pattern of interest**.

`"aeiou"` will match **exactly** the string `"aeiou"`. It does not allow for any variation.
`"[aeiou]{5}"` will match any string that consists of **five consecutive vowels** (in lowercase). characters must appear consecutively. It will match strings like `"aeiou"`, `"aaaee"`, but not `"abcde"`.


***Wildcards and Regex:***
While wildcards, such as `*` or `?`, can be used to express basic patterns, regex provides a more powerful and flexible mechanism for creating complex search patterns like,
- Matching sequences of characters.
- Requiring specific numbers of characters.
- Allowing optional characters.

### Metacharacters in Regex

The **regex** used in Linux was adopted from **POSIX** (Portable Operating System Interface for Unix), a series of standards that OS developers followed to ensure Unix and Unix-like systems shared features.

The original metacharacters described by POSIX form the **Basic Regular Expression** (BRE) set. Later, POSIX introduced the **Extended Regular Expression** (ERE) set, which uses the same metacharacters but with some differences, such as not requiring the backslash (`\`) for certain characters.

In regex, **brackets** (`[]`) are used to define a set of possible characters that can be matched. These brackets allow for more flexible and complex pattern matching.
- `[aeiou]` : Matches **any lowercase vowel**. It will match `a`, `e`, `i`, `o`, or `u`.
- `[a-e]`: Matches any of the characters from **a to e**. This includes `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, and `e`.
- `[[:lower:]]` : This is an example of a **POSIX character class** within brackets. It matches any **lowercase letter** (equivalent to `[a-z]`).


---

### **POSIX Metacharacters in Regular Expressions:**

- **`^`**: Anchors the match to the **beginning** of the string.
    `^cat` matches "cat" only if it appears at the start of the string.

- **`$`**: Anchors the match to the **end** of the string.
    `cat$` matches "cat" only if it appears at the end of the string.

- **`*`**: Matches **0 or more** occurrences of the preceding element.
    `a*` matches "a", "aa", "aaa", or even an empty string.

- **`+`**: Matches **1 or more** occurrences of the preceding element.
    `a+` matches "a", "aa", "aaa", but **not** an empty string.

- **`?`**: Matches **0 or 1** occurrence of the preceding element.
    `a?` matches "" (empty string) or "a".

- **`.`**: Matches any **single character** (except newline).
    `a.b` matches "aab", "acb", "a1b", but **not** "ab" (missing character between "a" and "b").

- **`[]`**: Character class; matches any **one of the characters inside the brackets**.
    `[aeiou]` matches any vowel (e.g., "a", "e", "i", etc.).

- **`|`**: **Alternation**; matches either the pattern on the left or right.
    `cat|dog` matches either "cat" or "dog".

- **`()**`: **Grouping**; groups part of a regular expression.
    `(abc)+` matches "abc" repeated one or more times, e.g., "abc", "abcabc", etc.

- **`\`**: **Escape character**; used to escape special characters.
    `\.` matches a literal dot ".", and `\$` matches a literal dollar sign "$".

- **`{m}`**: Matches **exactly m occurrences** of the preceding element.
    `a{3}` matches exactly "aaa".

- **`{m,n}`**: Matches between **m and n occurrences** of the preceding element.
    `a{3,5}` matches "aaa", "aaaa", or "aaaaa".

- **`?`** (as non-greedy): Makes the preceding character **optional** or **non-greedy**.
    `a+?` matches the smallest possible match, i.e., it will match "a" rather than "aaa".


     
____
     

- **`\b`**: **Word boundary**.
    `\bcat\b` matches "cat" only if it appears as a whole word, not as part of a larger word like "catalog".

- **`\B`**: **Non-word boundary**.
    `\Bcat\B` matches "cat" if it is **not** at the start or end of a word (e.g., "scatalog").

- **`\d`**: Matches any **digit** (equivalent to `[0-9]`).
    `\d+` matches one or more digits, such as "123" or "42".

- **`\D`**: Matches any **non-digit** character.
    `\D+` matches one or more non-digit characters, such as "abc" or "!@#".

- **`\w`**: Matches any **word character** (letters, digits, and underscore, equivalent to `[a-zA-Z0-9_]`).
    `\w+` matches a sequence of word characters, such as "abc123" or "_username".

- **`\W`**: Matches any **non-word character**.
    `\W+` matches a sequence of non-word characters, such as `!!`, `@#$`, etc.

- **`\s`**: Matches any **whitespace character** (space, tab, newline).
    `\s+` matches one or more whitespace characters, such as spaces or tabs.

- **`\S`**: Matches any **non-whitespace** character.
    `\S+` matches a sequence of non-whitespace characters, such as "abc123" or "_hello".

### **POSIX Character Classes:**

- **`[:alnum:]`**: Matches any **alphanumeric** character (letters in any case and digits, equivalent to `[a-zA-Z0-9]`).   
	`[[:alnum:]]` matches "a", "1", "X", "b2", etc.    
	
- **`[:alpha:]`**: Matches any **alphabetic** character (letters, equivalent to `[a-zA-Z]`).
    `[[:alpha:]]` matches "a", "b", "Z", "X", but **not** digits or symbols.

- **`[:blank:]`**: Matches a **space or tab** character (`[ \t]`).
    `[[:blank:]]` matches spaces and tabs.

- **`[:cntrl:]`**: Matches any **control character** (ASCII 0â€“31).
    `[[:cntrl:]]` matches control characters like `^C`, `^D`, etc.

- **`[:digit:]`**: Matches any **digit** (equivalent to `[0-9]`).
    `[[:digit:]]` matches "0", "5", "9", etc.

- **`[:graph:]`**: Matches any **printable character excluding space** (e.g., `a`, `A`, `1`, etc.).
    `[[:graph:]]` matches "a", "A", "!", "1", but **not** space.

- **`[:lower:]`**: Matches any **lowercase letter** (equivalent to `[a-z]`).
    `[[:lower:]]` matches "a", "b", "z", etc.

- **`[:print:]`**: Matches any **printable character**, including space (equivalent to `[[:graph:] ]`).
    `[[:print:]]` matches "a", "1", " ", but **not** control characters.

- **`[:punct:]`**: Matches any **punctuation** character (e.g., `.`, `!`, `?`, `;`, etc.).
    `[[:punct:]]` matches ".", "!", "?", ";", etc.

- **`[:space:]`**: Matches any **whitespace** character (space, tab, newline, carriage return, etc.).
	`[[:space:]]` matches " ", "\t", "\n", etc.

- **`[:upper:]`**: Matches any **uppercase letter** (equivalent to `[A-Z]`).
	`[[:upper:]]` matches "A", "B", "Z", etc.

- **`[:xdigit:]`**: Matches any **hexadecimal digit** (equivalent to `[0-9a-fA-F]`).
    `[[:xdigit:]]` matches "1", "a", "F", "9", etc.

---

`^[[:alpha:]]+$` : This will match strings that consist only of alphabetic characters (both lowercase and uppercase).

`[[:digit:]]{3,5}` : This will match 3 to 5 consecutive digits.

### **Controlling Repeated Characters Through `*`, `+`, `?`**

These are used to express a variable number of times that `preceding character` in regex can appear in the string.

`*`: The preceding character can appear **0 or more times**.
    `1*0*` matches `11111000000`, `111111110`, `10`, `0`, or even an **empty string**.

   
`+` : The preceding character can appear **1 or more times**.
    `1+0+` matches `111110000`, `1111110`, `10`  
    but **not** `0`, `1111`, or an **empty string**.


`?` : The preceding character can appear **0 or 1 time**.
    `1?0?` matches `1`, `0`, `10`, or an **empty string**.

___

`a*b*c*` : Matches `aaaaabbbc`, `abc`, `ab`, `bbbbb`, or even **empty string**. (will match `abacab)
`a+b+c+` : Matches `aaaaabbbc`, `abc`, `abbbbbc`, but **not** an empty string or `1111`.
`a?b?c?` : Matches `abc`, `ab`, or **empty string**.
None will match with `abaaabc`as the letters are not in correct sequence.


**Literal Characters:** A regex can contain literal characters without the metacharacters modifying them.
`jpe?g` : Matches `jpeg` or `jpg` (with `e` being optional and `j,p, g` a must).
`hello!?` : Matches `hello` or `hello!` (with `!` being optional).


___

### **Using `.` (Dot)**

**`.`** matches any single character except a newline.   

`b.t` will match any string that has `b` followed by **any one character**, followed by `t`.
- It will match: `bat`, `bbt`, `b0t`, `b#t`, `b t`
- It will **not** match: `bt` (missing the middle character)
- `batt` (too many characters)


**`...`** (three dots) will match any three characters, including three blank spaces.



**Combining with Other Metacharacters** like `*`, `+`, and `?` can modify `.` to allow for more flexible matches:

**`.*`**: Matches any sequence of characters (including zero characters). `b.?t` means `b` followed by zero or one character of any kind followed by a `t`.
    `b.*t` will match: `bat`, `bbt`, `b0t`, `b#t`, `b t`, `bt`, `batt`, `b t`

**`.+`**: Matches any sequence of **one or more characters**.
    `b.+t` will match: `bat`, `bbbbbbt`, `b t`, `b?!!#&*t`, `bait`, `b00t`
     It will **not** match:  `bt` (since there must be at least one character between `b` and `t`)

**`.?`**: Matches zero or one character of any kind.
	`b.?t` will match: `bt`, `bat`, `b?t`, `b#t`, etc.


---


### Controlling Where a Pattern Matches

A regular expression need not match the full string, it can match **any substring** within a string, which is a contiguous sequence of characters found within the larger string.
- `a*b*c*` will match `abacab` because it looks for **zero or more occurrences** of `a`, `b`, and `c` in any order.
- `b.t` will match `batt` as it matches `b`, any character (represented by `.`), and `t`. It will also match strings like `bbbbbatttt` because it matches the substring "bat".
- `b?.t` and `b?.t+` will also match substrings within `bbbbbatttt`.

regex patterns like `a*`, `char*`, or `a*b*` can be too broad, matching anything and everything, becoming useless. 
To control where the regex matches, we can use anchors to enforce specific positions in the string.

*  **`^`** : Asserts the beginning of a string.
*  **`$`** : Asserts the end of a string.
*  **`^ and $`** : Asserts the start and end of the string, ensuring the entire string must match the pattern.

---

**`^b?.t`**:
- Will **not** match `bbbbbbatttt` because the pattern starts at the beginning of the string, where it expects an optional `b` (`b?`), followed by any character (`.`), and then `t`. However, the sequence does not match at the start.
- `b?` matches the first `b`, the `.` marks the second `b` but the `t+` does not match as the next character is not `t`.


**`^b?.t+`**:
- This will **not** match `bbbbbbatttt` either because it starts with an optional `b`, followed by any character, and then `t+` (one or more `t`s). The next character after the first `b` does not meet the pattern.
- Matches a string that starts with 0 or 1 `b` because `b?` insists that there should be no more than one `b`. The next should be any one character followed by `t`.


**`b?.t+$`**:
- This will **match** `bbbbbatttt` because it scans the string from left to right, allowing for zero or more `b`s, followed by one character, and ending with one or more `t`s at the end of the string.


**`^b?.t+$`**:
- This will **match** strings that start with zero or one `b`, followed by any character, and ending with one or more `t`s.
	`batttt`, `bbttttt`, `attttt`.


**`^0a*1+`**:
- This will match strings that start with a `0`, followed by zero or more `a`'s, and at least one `1`.
	`0a1`, `0aaaa111`, `101111`, `01`.
- There can be any character after `1`. `0a1a` `011100`


**`^0a*1+$`**:
- This variation **fixes** the ending part to ensure it ends with one or more `1`s, with no characters following the `1`. It will match:  `0a1`,  `0aaaa111`,  `10111`.

**`^$`**:    
- This matches the **empty string**. It asserts that there is nothing between the start and end of the string.

### Matching From a List of Options

When we want to match a **set of characters** without caring about their specific order to indicate "any of these", we can use **character classes**. 
These are defined with **square brackets** (`[]`), which specify that the next character in the string must match **any single character** from the list of options inside the brackets.

***Types of Lists:*** as given by the notation inside the bracket.

1. **Enumerated List**: `[abcd]` Matches **any one of** the characters `a`, `b`, `c`, or `d`, in any order. There should be no separators.
	**`[abc][abc][abc]`** or **`[a-c][a-c][a-c]`**: This matches any **three consecutive characters** where each character is one of `a`, `b`, or `c`, in any combination. `abc`, `acb`, `bca`, `aaa`, `bbb`, `bcc`, `zyxaaa`, `@aaa@`, `aaaaa`, `1cba2`.
	`[abcxyz]` `[abcdABCD]` `[abc1234]`


2. **Range**:  `[a-f]` Matches **any one of** the characters from `a` to `f`, inclusive. This is equivalent to writing `[a, b, c, d, e, f]`.
	**Range Combinations**:
	- `[a-cx-z]` : Matches any character from the sets `a` to `c` **or** `x` to `z`.
	- `[a-d1-4]` : Matches any character from the sets `a` to `d` **or** `1` to `4`.
	- `[a-dA-D]` : Matches any character from the sets `a` to `d` **or** `A` to `D`.


3. **Character Class**: A POSIX **character class** is a predefined group that matches a set of characters based on a certain property.
	**`[:alpha:]`** matches **any alphabetic character** (equivalent to `[a-zA-Z]`).
   **`[:punct:]`**. This matches any punctuation character such as `.`, `,`, `!`, etc. (there's no direct range for all punctuation marks).

___


### Combining `[]` with `*`  `+` `?`

To control the number of times we expect the characters in the bracket to appear.

`[abc]+` will match any string that contains a sequence of one or more characters in the set, as long as there is at least one character.
`[abc]*` matches the empty string also. (without `^ $` it will match unlimited number of strings, even 1234) so `^[abc]*$` will only match strings that consist solely of zero or more `a, b, c`'s


finding a string that consists only of letters `^[a-zA-Z]+$` or `^[[:alpha:]]+$`
for one with only numbers `^[0-9]+$` or `^[[:digit:]]+$`
for anything with only punctuation marks `^[[:punct:]]+$`

To match any string that consists only of letters but ends with one punctuation mark.
`^[A-Za-z]+[[:punct:]]+$` and `^[[:alpha:]]+[[:punct:]]+$`
(plus is not between, it is combined with each character class)

To match string with letters and all punctuation marks.
`^[[:alpha:][:punct:]]+$` this represents that entire string consists of one or more(`+`) of characters in the brackets. Both are not an enumerated list but two different classes which are given as alternatives.

Finding a name where first name last name has first letter uppercase and remaining lower case. this can be `[A-Z][a-z]+`.
The middle initial will be a single upper case letter if it appears, which can be `[A-Z]?`
So the name can be `^[A-Z][a-z]+ [A-Z]? [A-Z][a-z]+`, but if the middle letter is not available, then this regex is looking for a string with two spaces in the middle.


### Matching characters that must not appear

To not contain a specific character. Like without any blank space in it.
`^[...]+$` is "all characters except the blank space"
it would be convenient to specify "must not include" using `[^ ]`.

The `^`, when used inside of brackets means "match if the next character in the string is not matching anything in the bracket". The blank space indicates the only character we do not want to match against.
adding `^$` to match entire string and to specify that it can contain multiple characters as long as it not a space using `+` we will have `^[^ ]+$`


### Matching Metacharaters Literally

If the punctuation marks used for the regex are required as a literal chracter like `$ .`
To use a punctuation mark that is a metacharacter but not to be found literally, we need to escape the meaning of that punctuation mark using escape character `\`.
`\$[0-9]+\.[0-9][0-9]`   a regex for a dollar and a cent amount.
An alternative is to place the punctuation marks in the `[]`
`[$][0-9]+[.][0-9][0-9]`

To find a addition `number + number = number` here `=` is not a meta character.
`[0-9]+ \+ [0-9]+ = [0-9]+`
`[0-9]+ [+] [0-9]+ = [0-9]+`

To match any other mathematical expression we can go with the `[]` and `-` is in beginning or end or it can be escaped `\-`
`[0-9]+ [-+/*] [0-9]+ = [0-9]+`

`$` is a metacharacter used to express the end of a expression, so if `$` appears anywhere other than the end, it is taken literally as dollar sign so does not require backslash.
Similarly `^` appearing anywhere other than the beginning is taken literally.
`-` also should appear in the middle of the `[]`
`$[0-9]+ [+] [0-9]+ \. [0-9][0-9]`


### More precisely controlling repetition

With `* +` we can indicate that a pattern of characters can be repeated but cannot control the number of repetition.
with `?` we have slight control in that the number occurences is limited to eaither 0 or 1.

To control the number of repetitions we use `{}` within which we can specify one or two numbers which will represent the maximum or the minimum number of occurances.

The three formats are  
`{m}` to match exactly m occurances of preceding character
`{m.n}` to indicate that the preceding characters must match between m and n (m<n)
`{n,}` to indicate atleast n occurances

`[0-9]{5}` matches exactly five digits.
`[0-9]{3}-[0-9]{4}` to represent a phone number

To get IPv4 address with four octet numbers between 0 and 255
wrong method would be `[0-255].[0-255].[0-255].[0-255]` because there is no range defined between 0 and 255, it is just 0 to 9.
so `[0-255]` is interpreted as 0 to 2 and 5 and 5 (0, 1, 2, 5, 5).
The `.` is also a metacharacter to match any single character.

`[0-9]{0-3}\.[0-9]{0-3}\.[0-9]{0-3}\.[0-9]{0-3}`
Still the three numbers can be more than 255 and go upto 999 which is not right,

`^[^0-9]*[0-9]{5}[^0-9]*$`


### Selecting between sequences

`OR` is the `|` vertical bar. This OR is used between two or more regular expressions

Using `()`
`(...)+` to show this group may repeat and 
`(...)?` to sow the group is optional


`^[A-Z][a-z]+ ([A-Z]\. )?[A-Z][a-z]+`
