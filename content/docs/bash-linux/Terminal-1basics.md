Bash - `Bourne Again SHell`
(git Bash - for windows interaction with git )


## Bash

```bash {frame="none"}
Ctrl + Alt + T  # Launch terminal  
Ctrl + Shift + C  # for copying from terminal  
Ctrl + Shift + V  # for pasting in terminal  
clear      # to clear the terminal
```

The grammar of a shell allows to combine existing tools into powerful pipelines and handle large volumes of data automatically.
Sequence of commands written in a 'script', improves the reproduciblity of workflows.


## Terminal Basics

`su`  -  super user  
`sudo`  -   getting the super user permission  
`apt `  -  the installer

```c
sudo apt install update
sudo apt upgrade
```

`$`  is the prompt for typing, followed by a blinking text cursor.  
`$ whoami`


`--help` can be passed to any command  to see what option a command accepts
```c
cd --help
ls --help
mkdir --help
```

```c
help cd
help echo  # works
```
If there are long `--` and short `-` versions of a command,  
use short when typing command in the terminal, use long in scripts when it is written once and read many times.

`man` is manual for a command if it exists.
```c
man ls
man mkdir
```

`space` and `B` used to travel in manual,  
`/` is used to search for a term,  
`N` is used to move between the hits,  
`N+Shift` for moving backwards.

`man cd` doesn't exist as it is a built is function `--help` can be used.


## General Syntax of a Shell command

```c
$ ls -F /
```
Listing of files & directories in Root directory /  
`$` is the prompt  
`ls` is the command  
`-F` is the option/flag/switches  
`/` is the argument

'Command' doesn't always require argument or option.  
'Command' can be called with more than one 'options' & 'arguments'.  
( 'options' and 'arguments' are referred to as 'parameters')

'Options' change the behavior of a 'command'		  
'short options' start with single dash ' - ',   `-r`   `-a`		  
'long options' start with double dash '--'   `--reverse`    `--all`

'Arguments' tell the command what to operate on (files and directories)

{{< callout >}} Each parts are separated by spaces, if space is omitted, the difference between command, option and argument will not be known to the terminal.	  
    (  `ls-F`   searches for a command called `ls-F`  which doesn't exist)
{{< /callout >}}

Capital and Small are also important			  
`ls -s`   displays size of listed files.		  
`ls -S`  sorts the displayed files.

## Navigating Files and Directories

Directory names in a path are separated by `/` in unix, `\` in windows


### Tab completion

When there is only one option, like Document or Download, hitting `tab` on D will show both Document/ Download.     (Double tab will show if there are more than one)	  
Doc + Tab will bring **Documents**

```c
~/Documents/Odin-Project/foundations/java-script/calculator/
Doc tab      O tab     f tab     j tab    cal  tab
```
*  `.`  for opening everything in a project directory
*  `git add .`  to add all files in a directory to Git staging area
* In VS code, opening `cd` in project directory and typing   `code .`    opens project folder
* `code` in terminal launches VS code


### *pwd* Print Working Directory

`pwd`  print working directory, shows current working directory(shows where we are)		  
`/` indicates the root directory,  `/Users/sujith`  it is the slash before the user.


### Relative and Absolute Paths

When '***Relative paths***' are used with commands `ls` and `cd`, it tries to find that location   
'from where we are' rather than from the root of the file system.   
So it can only look at files within that directory and the `..` parent directory

***Absolute paths*** can be specified by including its entire entire path from the root directory indicated by a leading slash  `/`		  
This tells the computer to follow the path from the root of file system so it always refers to one directory.

(Using `pwd` to see the route and typing the absolute path to wherever we want to go)  
`~`  tilde character at the start of a path mean **the current users home directory**  
	( `~/data`  is equal to   `/Users/sujith/data`     useful for absolute path typing)


### *cd* change directory

`cd  <name>`    Change directory(changes the shells current working directory)  
	(can only move into directories like this, but not out of it with relative paths)

`cd ~`    going to the home directory at once ( `home/sujith`)

`cd ..`   moves back to parent directory  
	( `..` is a special directory meaning "the directory containing this one" i.e parent directory)  
	(`.` by itself means current directory)

`cd -`   the `-` in front moves to the previous directory we were in,  
`cd -`   again will bring us back ( it is switching between current and previous directories only )

( `cd /`  goes to root directory,  `cd ~` goes to home directory  )  
( `cd ../..`  goes up by two level, parent of parent)


### *ls* listing

`ls` listing to check files and directories in the directory.  
All these options/flags can be combined like `ls -Fal  -lF  -aF`

flags for `ls`  
  `-l`  crates a list of things  
  `-h`  does something i couldn't figure  
  `-a`  'show all' shows hidden directories with `.` also `..` directory.  
  ( there will be other directories which start with `.` like `.bash_profile` these contain shell config settings, these are hidden to prevent cluttering )

  `-F`  gives an output separated with `/` marker to show what they are, (ones with no marker are files)

`ls -R` to list all nested sub directories within a directories


#### Looking at other directories contents without moving out

```c
ls ~/Desktop/trial
ls /User/sujith/Desktop/trial
ls -F Desktop
```
