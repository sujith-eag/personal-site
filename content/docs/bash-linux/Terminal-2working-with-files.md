## Creating Directories

Open where a directory has to be added.     
`mkdir [name]`  to 'make directory' in the current directory.     
	Using relative path without leading slash.

`-p`  for multiple directories      
`mkdir -p` creates a directory with nested sub-directories in a single operation.     
`mkdir -p ../project/data ../project/results`.      

`ls -R` to list all nested sub directories within a directories.

To make a directory `2016` which has `data` and that has 2 directory `processed` and `raw`
```c
# method one                     # method two
mkdir 2016                        mkdir 2016
mkdir 2016/data                   cd 2016
mkdir 2016/data/processed         mkdir data
mkdir 2016/data/raw               cd data
.                                 mkdir raw processed

# method three
mkdir -p 2016/data/raw
mkdir -p 2016/data/processed
# `-p` is creating any intermediate directory

mkdir north south pacific
# will create 3 different directories.
```




## Naming Conventions

* Don't use spaces as arguments need space separation in command line.
* Use `_` or `-` instead of space.
* Don't start with `-` as it will be considered as option/flag.
* Stick with `0-9, a-z . - _`  as other symbols have different meaning.
* To refer to names with spaces or other special characters, surround the name in single quotes ' '.

***Single Quotes*** -     
Enclosing characters in single quotes ' ' preserves the literal value of each character within the quotes.

***Escape Character*** -      
A non-quoted backslash `\` is the escape character.     
It preserves the literal value of the next character that follows, with exception of newline.


## Create a text file

### Using nano editor

`nano` text editor is used to create a `txt` file.      
`nano draft.txt` will open nano text editor, data can be typed and then saved(many more options) commands are accessed by holding down `Ctr`.

`nano` can only work with plain character data, no tables or images.      
`nano` can do only this basic operation.

Programmers use `Emacs` or `Vim`.
Graphical editors such as `Gedit` or `VScode`.      
On windows there are `Notecode++`.  `notepad` can run like `nano`


### *touch* command

`touch my_file.txt` creates a blank text file.      
`touch  <name.txt>`  to make a file.


### *rm* for Removing a file

`rm my_file.txt`    file gets removed.        
`rm -i`  will ask for confirmation before the deletion.       
`rm` works only on files, not on directories.  `rm thesis`  raises an error.    
`rm -i thesis/quote.txt` will work after confirmation.

We can remove a directory and all its contents by using the recursive `-r`      
`rm -r thesis`   `rm -r -i`

`rm -i *.txt`  removing all `.txt` file in directory with permission needed for each.

Shell does not have any trash bin so any file deleted is actually deleted.


## Moving files and directories

### Renaming by moving a file to new name!!

`mv [old] [new]`  moves or renames a file or directory.

While in directory behind the directory with file.     
```c
$ mv trial/draft.txt  trial/quotes.txt
```
The `draft.txt` file is moved to `quotes.txt`  which is similar to renaming the file.     

While in the same directory     
```c
$ mv draft.txt quotes.txt
```

When it is moved to a a directory with same file name, it will delete the previous file silently.
`mv` will not ask for confirmation by default.
An additional option, `mv -i` `mv --interactive` will cause `mv` to request such confirmation.

File can be moved to directory also

```c
$ mv trial/quotes.txt`
# this will move it from that directory to current one.

$ mv sucrose.dat maltase.dat ../raw
# moving two files to raw file in the parent directory
```

## Copying files and directories

`cp` works similar to `mv`, but copies the file.

```c
cp [old] [new]   # copies a file

$ cp quotes.txt thesis/quotation.txt
# copies file to another directory with different name.
```

A directory and all its contents are copied by using recursive option `-r`    
(like backing up directory)
```c
$ cp -r thesis thesis_backup
```

`-r` is used to copy the directory, if it is not included, the directory will be omitted.


## Operation with multiple files and directories

Copying or moving several files can be done by giving multiple files,

If given more than one file names followed by a directory name(directory as last argument)   
`cp` copies the files to the named directory
```c
$ mkdir backup

$ cd cretures/minotaur.dat creatures/unicorn.dat backup/

$ cd minotaur.dat unicorn.dat basilisk.dat
#all three are file names, makes a error, this can be handled by using wildcards.
```


## Wild Cards

'wildcards' are special characters that can be used to represent unknown characters or sets of characters when navigating the Unix system.

`ethane.pdb   methane.pdb   propane.pdb   pentane.pdb`        
`*` is a wild card which represents 0 or more characters.     
`*.pdb`  represents every file that ends with `.pdb`          
`*ethane.pdb` represents ethane and methane.                  
`p*.pdb` represents files that begin with `p` and has `.pdb`    

`?` is also a wildcard, but represents exactly one character.     
`?ethane.pdb`  represents only `methane.pdb`

Wild cards can be used in combination with one another.       
`???ane.pde`   is any three characters followed by `---ane.pde`

```c
ls *t*ane.pdb   # gives most of names
ls *t?ne.*     # gives octane pentane
ls *t??ne.pdb  # ethane methane
ls ethane.*    #only ethane
```
When a shell sees a wildcard it expands the wildcard to create a list of matching filenames before running the preceding command.

`*.pdf` in directory with `*.pdb` will throw error


### Using wildcards for copying
```c
$ cp *dataset* backup/datasets
# copy anything having dataset as name to datasets directory inside backups

$ cp *calibration.txt backup/calibration
# copying all calibration files

$ cp 2015-11-* send_to_bob/all_november_files/
# copying just November files

$ cp *-23-dataset* send_to_bob/all_datasets_created_on_23rd/
# just 23rd files
```
